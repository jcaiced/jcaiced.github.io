      "en":"In this work an implementation of a multidimensional transfer function is performed, expanding its domain through the magnitude of the gradient and the second directional derivative along the gradient, these calculations were obtained by the method of reconstruction of sum of convolutions. In addition, a widget-based interface was implemented for editing the transfer function. The tests show that the multidimensional transfer functions allow to improve the specification of the classification in the volumes, being able to isolate parts of the volume in an effective way."
